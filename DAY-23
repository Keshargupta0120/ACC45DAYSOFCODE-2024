You are given a string 
𝑆
S of length 
𝑁
N.

Your task is to delete a subsequence of maximum length from the string, such that, after concatenating the remaining parts of the string, it becomes a palindrome of length greater than 
1
1.

If this is possible, print the maximum length of the subsequence that can be deleted. Otherwise, print 
−
1
−1.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
𝑇
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of 
2
2 lines of input:
The first line consists the a single integer 
𝑁
N - the length of string 
𝑆
S.
The second line contains string 
𝑆
S, consisting of lowercase english alphabets.
Output Format
For each test case, if it is possible to delete a subsequence under the given conditions, print a single integer, denoting the maximum length of the subsequence that can be deleted. Otherwise, print 
−
1
−1.
